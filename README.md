This project compares two voice samples using a simple GUI.

The user uploads one audio file.
The user records the second voice sample directly from the GUI.
The program then checks how closely the two voices match.

The GUI is built using Tkinter.
No external AI or ML libraries are required.
Only Python and Tkinter are needed to see the visual output.

The project runs smoothly in Jupyter Notebook and as a .py file.
Designed for learning and experimentation with voice matching logic.

Audio formats supported: WAV, MP3, M4A.
